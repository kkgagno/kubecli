Pending kernel upgrade!
Running kernel version:
  6.8.0-62-generic
Diagnostics:
  The currently running kernel version is not the expected kernel version 6.8.0-63-generic.

Restarting the system to load the new kernel will not be handled automatically, so you should consider rebooting.

Restarting services...

Service restarts being deferred:
 /etc/needrestart/restart.d/dbus.service
 systemctl restart docker.service
 systemctl restart getty@tty1.service
 systemctl restart systemd-logind.service
 systemctl restart unattended-upgrades.service

No containers need to be restarted.

User sessions running outdated binaries:
 keith @ session #355: sshd[1027687]
 keith @ user manager service: systemd[860]

No VM guests are running outdated hypervisor (qemu) binaries on this host.
